"NOTE: To estimate the margin of error, the standard error is scaled based on the desired level of confidence in the estimate. Throughout the Condition of Education, margins of error are produced based on a 95 percent level of confidence. Margin of error is calculated as 1.96 * standard error.  Data are based on sample surveys of the civilian noninstitutionalized population, which excludes persons living in institutions (e.g., prisons or nursing facilities) and all military personnel. The employment rate, or employment-to-population ratio, is the number of persons in each group who are employed as a percentage of the civilian noninstitutionalized population in that group. Caution should be used when comparing 2019, 2020, and 2021 estimates with those of other years due to the impact that the coronavirus pandemic had on interviewing and response rates. For additional information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Current Population Survey data collection, please see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/techdocs/cpsmar23.pdf. Figures are plotted based on unrounded data.",,,,,,,,
